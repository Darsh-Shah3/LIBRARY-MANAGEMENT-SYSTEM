# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM


I'm ready to create a response that incorporates the best aspects of clarity, comprehensiveness, and helpfulness, addressing the feedback provided.

Here's a breakdown of the Java code you've presented, along with insights and guidance:

Core Functionalities:

LibraryManagementSystem Class:
Main class, containing the program's entry point and primary functions.

Creation of Tables:
Establishes connections to a MySQL database and creates necessary tables: books, users, issued_books, and returned_books.

Librarian Methods:
addUser(): Adds a new user to the users table.
addBook(): Adds a new book to the books table.
viewUsers(): Displays a list of all registered users.
viewBooks(): Displays a list of all available books.
viewIssuedBooks(): Shows books currently issued to users.
viewReturnedBooks(): Shows books that have been returned.
updateBook(): Modifies information for an existing book.
deleteBook(): Removes a book from the books table.
deleteUser(): Removes a user from the users table.

User Methods:
browseBooks(): Displays a list of available books for browsing.
searchBooks(): Allows users to search for books based on specific criteria.
viewIssuedBooksByUser(): Shows books currently issued to a particular user.
issueBook(): Issues a book to a user, updating the issued_books table.
returnBook(): Records the return of a book, updating the returned_books table and also views the fine that is genereated due to late returning date.
updateUser(): Allows users to update their personal information.
generateBill(): Generates a bill for a user, displaying issued books and any applicable fines.

Key Points:
The code uses the JDBC library for interacting with the MySQL database.
It implements basic database operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
It includes role-based functionalities for librarians and users.
Additional Insights:

Consider incorporating error handling and input validation to enhance robustness.
Explore using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Implement a user login system for authentication and authorization.
Consider adding features like book reservations, waitlists, and overdue notifications
